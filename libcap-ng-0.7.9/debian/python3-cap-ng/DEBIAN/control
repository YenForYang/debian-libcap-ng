Description: Python3 bindings for libcap-ng
 This library implements the user-space interfaces to the POSIX
 1003.1e capabilities available in Linux kernels.  These capabilities are
 a partitioning of the all powerful root privilege into a set of distinct
 privileges.
 .
 The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming with POSIX
 capabilities much easier than the traditional libcap library.
 .
 This package contains the Python3 bindings for libcap-ng.
